We have polymer system (CHT_np60.gro (you can watch it in programm VMD)).
Acilation degree and protonation degree are random.
Programm must to add residue ACE2 on H22 place and rename CHT to CHTR. (Acilation)
And change CHT to CHTP and add H23 (protonation)
We can't change CHT0 and CHTN residue, but we must take them into account when calculating.
User sent input system, output system, percent of protonation and percent of acilation.
